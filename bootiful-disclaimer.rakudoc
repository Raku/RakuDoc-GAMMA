Absolutely no warranty is implied. B<Not even of any kind>. We have sold
you this C<software> with no hint of a suggestion that it is either useful
or usable. As for guarantees of correctness...don't make us laugh!

At U<some> time in the future we might deign to sell you upgrades that purport
to address some of the application's many deficiencies, but no promises
there either. We have more lawyers on staff than you have total
employees, so don't even B<I<think>> about suing us.

Have a nice day. E< WHITE SMILING FACE >
